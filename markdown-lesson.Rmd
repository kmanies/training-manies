# Data sources
The file we're using is BGchem2008data.csv, which we downloaded from the NCEAS site. Then we did a bunch of stuff to it:

* create data folder
* upload data files
* 

```{r}
bg_chem <- read.csv("data/BGchem2008data.csv")
```

# Plots
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot <- plot(bg_chem$Target_Depth, bg_chem$CTD_Temperature)
```
